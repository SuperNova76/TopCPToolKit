Various scale factors are computed by the respective CP algorithms. The default approach is that the relevant object blocks compute and decorate per-object SFs, and some of them also by default store these per-object SFs as vectors of floats in the output NTuple. Please refer to the documentation of the relevant objects under [Settings](index.md).

!!! tip
    To disable the per-object SFs, use the branch filtering feature of [`OutputAnalysisConfig``](ntupling.md/#outputanalysisconfig).

## Config blocks

### [PerEventSFBlock](https://acode-browser1.usatlas.bnl.gov/lxr/source/athena/PhysicsAnalysis/Algorithms/AsgAnalysisAlgorithms/python/AsgAnalysisConfig.py)
Name in YAML: **PerEventSF**

Calculates a per-event SF which is the product of per-object SFs, for objects passing an optional selection.

`algoName`
:   unique name given to the underlying algorithm computing the per-event scale factors

`particles`
:   the input object container, with a possible selection, in the format `container` or `container.selection`.

`objectSF`
:   the name of the per-object SF decoration to be used.

`eventSF`
:   the name of the per-event SF decoration.

!!! success "Registers the following variables:"
    - The name of the output variable is the same as the one specified in the `eventSF` option.

###Â [LeptonSFCalculatorConfig](https://gitlab.cern.ch/atlasphys-top/reco/TopCPToolkit/-/blob/main/source/TopCPToolkit/python/LeptonSFCalculatorConfig.py)
Name in YAML: **LeptonSF**

Computes the per-event lepton SF, i.e. a product over the individual reconstruction, identification and isolation SFs for all electrons and muons in the event.

`electrons`
:   the input electron container, with a possible selection, in the format `container` or `container.selection`.

`muons`
:   the input muon container, with a possible selection, in the format `container` or `container.selection`.

`lepton_postfix`
:   the common postfix for both electrons and muons, e.g. `'tight'`.

!!! success "Registers the following variables:"
    - `leptonSF`: the per-event lepton SF, the product of the electron reconstruction/ID/isolation SFs and the muon reconstruction/TTVA/isolation SFs
