# Contributing

TopCPToolkit needs to adjust to the needs of a growing basis of users, but with a limited number of maintainers.
Feedback, bug fixes and improvements from the community are therefore very welcome!

## How to contribute

Your first port of call is the [issue tracker](https://gitlab.cern.ch/atlasphys-top/reco/TopCPToolkit/-/issues).
There you can communicate with the developer team, and make changes happen.
