# Welcome to TopCPToolkit ! :partying_face:

TopCPToolkit is an ntuple production framework for Run 2 and Run 3 analyses, developed by and for members of the Top WG.
It is built around **common CP and analysis algorithms** in release 24, and meant as the successor to [AnalysisTop](https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/viewauth/AtlasProtected/TopxAODStartGuideR21).
This websites serves to document the usage and main features of the framework, as well as provide links to references and other resources.

!!! tip
    This code is being continuously developed.
    We advise subgroup conveners and analysis contacts to appoint only experienced people to design analysis workflows and prepare ntuple productions with it.
